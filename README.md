# ScreenCapture
UWP screen capture app. For quick, easy to make recordings.

Originally came from my distaste for all the quick screen capture tools I could find upon coming back to Windows. They all pail in comparison to [this awesome script](https://github.com/dbermond/screencast/). I've gotten ShareX to work well enough...

At a standstill. Trying to find an effective & non-volatile way to have ffmpeg interoperability in C# considering the UWP sandbox's limitations (p/invoke & libavcodec?). Not having much success yet.
A lot of the cool UI is done, though ([video](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1013121389361889302/1074751796465111160/ApplicationFrameHost_U2XD42QV4j.mp4))
